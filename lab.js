// Part 2: Practical Math
// Let’s look at a more practical scenario.
// You are planning a cross-country road trip!
// The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles. 



// Your car’s fuel efficiency is as follows:
// At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
// At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
// At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
// You have a fuel budget of $175.
// The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
// Set up a program to answer the following questions:
// How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
// Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
// How long will the trip take, in hours?

const tripDist = 1500
const fuelCost = 3
const budget = 175 
let mpg = 30
let mph = 55


let howMuchFuel = tripDist / mpg 
console.log(howMuchFuel + " gallons needed")
 
let enoughMoney = howMuchFuel * fuelCost
console.log(enoughMoney + " dollars")

let hours = tripDist / mph
console.log(hours + " hours away")
